So you want to join the Extractors and become yourself part of our illustrious group of Recon Scouts and Tech Snatchers? 
Well, let's start with the basics then.

Our job is to move in and out of human premises unseen, collecting valuable hardware and keeping a tap on what drives the humans currently.
Clearly important work for our nest and the clusters beyond.

Your mission is to traverse the den of these humans without causing an alarm. Stick to the walls of below protective furniture, as by our
conditioning.

Once a human notices you, they will investigate and you have a short time frame until they register that there is an intruder in their 
premises. Use this time to find cover quickly. Then wait. Humans tend to have a freightfully short memory span and will forget your 
appearance shortly.
